                <span>overflow-hidden</span>There is a proverb: “Good clothes
                open all doors”. It means that when people don’t know you they
                judge you by appearance and especially clothes. When you see the
                person wearing a perfect expensive suit your brain creates the
                image of successful businessmen in front of you. Instead, the
                person wearing old jeans and simple T-shirt won’t be allowed to
                enter the restaurant or many other establishments. It’s
                considered normal, but should it be this way?For the vast
                majority of people, the word “fashion” means a lot and makes
                their way of living. Nowadays it’s still associated with clothes
                and accessories but, moreover, it influences our choice of food,
                technologies and even medicine. A lot of people waste money in

                <span>overflow-visible</span>One more important thing that we
                lose trying to be in fashion is our comfort. Most clothes
                perfectly suit fashion shows and ideal model bodies but not the
                real life. Choosing extremely fashionable things you risk
                looking funny and dull. Anyway, the power of fashion industry is
                so strong that it’s difficult to struggle with the desire to be
                similar to people from magazine covers or billboards.For the
