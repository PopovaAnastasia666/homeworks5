                <span>overflow-hidden</span> There is a proverb: “Good clothes open all doors”. It means that when people don’t know you they judge you by appearance and especially clothes. When you see the person wearing a perfect expensive suit your brain creates the image of successful businessmen in front of you. Instead, the person wearing old jeans and a simple T-shirt won’t be allowed to enter the restaurant or many other establishments.

Most clothes perfectly suit fashion shows and ideal model bodies but not real life. Choosing extremely fashionable things you risk looking funny and dull. Anyway, the power of fashion industry is so strong that it’s difficult to struggle with the desire to be similar to people from magazine covers or billboards.
